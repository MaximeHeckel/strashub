#Strashub



This project aims to provide a complete API for the city of Strasbourg including bars, restaurants, sights and public transportation. All the data is now located in a single place in order to facilitate data access for developers.


##API Endpoints

This first version includes 3 endpoints. The main url to access the data is [https://strashub.scalingo.io/](https://strashub.scalingo.io/)

	GET /places/tourism
	
	



##Where does the data come from ?

This API hub pulls its data from foursquare api, yelp api and some governments api's then stores it into another database.
